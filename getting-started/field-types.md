# Rock Field Types

A number of Rock Field Types have been implemented. This means you can use Rock Attributes which make use of these field types. Currently the only block that supports Attributes is the Workflow Entry block, though others may be added in the future.

* Boolean
* Campus
* Currency
* Date
* Day of Week
* Days of Week
* Decimal
* Email
* Integer
* Memo
* Select Multi
* Select Single
* Phone Number
* Text
* Url Link

> Not all of the features of the above fields are available. For example, a `Select Multi` has an option to display as check boxes. Since check boxes don't make sense on a mobile device that option is ignored.
