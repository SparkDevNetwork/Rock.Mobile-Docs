# Decoration

Mobile applications have limited ability to decorate text, therefore, we only have a few options for styling.

### Underline

Use the `.text-underline` utility class to underline text.

```text
<Label StyleClass="text-underline" Text="Lots of trouble. Lots of bubble." />
```

### Strikethrough

Use the `.text-strikethrough` utility class to place a line through your text.

```text
<Label StyleClass="text-strikethrough" Text="Lots of trouble. Lots of bubble." />
```
